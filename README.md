### Description

A little app that I made to generate a key according to username. Also this app will validate the key. This is a little bit more advanced. Most validation routines actually take the username that is put in, and generates a key for that. Then it will compare that and what the user entered. This leaves a big security hole because anybody with memory editors can actually use the actual program as the keygen. My app actually reverse engineers the key into a username then compares usernames. =) have fun and change it as you like. Also, please vote!
